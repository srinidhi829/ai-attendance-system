# AI Attendance System

## Overview

The AI Attendance System is a full-stack application that automates attendance management using face recognition technology. Instead of manually recording attendance, the system identifies registered students from classroom images and generates attendance records automatically.

The project combines a React frontend, a Node.js backend, and a Python-based machine learning service to provide an efficient and scalable attendance solution.

## System Architecture

1. Students are enrolled into the system.
2. Face data is processed and stored by the ML service.
3. Classroom images are uploaded for attendance processing.
4. The ML service identifies students using face recognition.
5. Attendance data is sent to the backend.
6. Records are stored and managed through the backend.
7. The frontend displays attendance information to users.
